OOP: Object Oriented Programming 

    is a programming paradigm based on the concept of  "objects" which can contain data,
    in the form of fields(often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures
    (often known as methods).

    procedural 
    ----------

    let width = 10
    var height = 20

    function calculateArea(width, height) {
        return width * height
    }

    function calculateRange(width, height) {
        return 2* (width + height)
    }

    let area = calculateArea(width, height)
    var range = calculateRange(width, height)

    Object Oriented 
    ---------------
    
    let rect = {
        width :10,
        height: 20,
        calculateArea: function() {
            return this.width * this.height
        },
        calculateRange: function() {
            return 2* (this.width + this.height)
        }
    }

    let area = rect.calculateArea()
    let range = rect.calculateRange()
