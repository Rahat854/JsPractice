Polymorphism 
============
The word polymorphism is used in various contexts and describes solutions in which something
occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that objects 
of different types can be accessed through the same interface. Each type can provibe its own,
independent implementation of this interface. It is one of the the core concepts of object
oriented programming(OOP).
